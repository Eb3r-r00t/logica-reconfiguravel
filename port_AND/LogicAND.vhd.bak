entity FPGA1 is
    port (in1: in std_logic;
        in2: in std_logic;
        in3: in std_logic;
        saida1: out std_logic;
        saida2: out std_logic
    );
end FPGA1;

architecture logica of FPGA1 is
begin
    saida1 <= (in1 and in2) or (in3);
    saida2 <= (in3 xor in2) and not (in3);
end logica;
